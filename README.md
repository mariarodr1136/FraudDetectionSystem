# FraudWatch: Credit Card Fraud Detection System üö®

FraudWatch is an advanced credit card fraud detection system designed to identify fraudulent transactions in real-time using machine learning techniques. Built with **Python** and **Flask**, the system processes transaction data to predict fraud using a **Random Forest classifier**, a powerful ensemble learning algorithm known for its high accuracy in classification tasks. The backend leverages **scikit-learn** for model training and evaluation, while the web application, built with **Flask**, serves as an interactive platform for users to engage with the results.

FraudWatch incorporates robust data preprocessing steps such as feature scaling using **StandardScaler** to ensure optimal model performance. For visualization, the system employs **Plotly**, a data visualization library that creates an interactive chart for the model's performance metrics, allowing users to explore how well the model classifies legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The chart enhances user experience by offering an intuitive, interactive view of model accuracy, false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives.

## Features
- **Fraud Detection**: The system predicts whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or legitimate using a Random Forest classifier.
- **Feature Scaling**: Data is preprocessed with **StandardScaler** to normalize the features.
- **Classification Report**: Detailed classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes (legitimate and fraudulent transactions).
- **Model Performance Metrics Chart**: Visualizes the performance of the model through an interactive line chart for accuracy, false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives using Plotly.
- **Sample Transaction Table**: Displays a table with a few sample transactions, showing their true class and predicted class, with color-coded indicators for correct or incorrect predictions.
- **User-friendly Web Application**: The system is packaged in a Flask web application to display results in an accessible and interactive format.

## Future Enhancements

- **Model Optimization**: Explore and integrate additional machine learning models such as **XGBoost** or **Gradient Boosting** to improve classification accuracy and model efficiency.
- **User Authentication**: Implement a user authentication system using **OAuth** or **JWT** for secure, personalized access to the application.
- **Real-Time Fraud Detection**: Integrate **real-time transaction data** for live fraud detection and alert generation.
- **Model Interpretability**: Incorporate **SHAP** or **LIME** for better understanding and visualization of how the model makes decisions.
- **Additional Data Sources**: Expand the dataset to include more features such as **transaction location** or **merchant information** to enhance fraud prediction.
- **Frontend Enhancements**: Improve the user interface by integrating more interactive elements and visualizations, such as **line charts** or **bar graphs**, for deeper insights into the model's performance.
